# Ball Defender

Author: Tyler Thompson

Design: You control an arc that rotates around a central square that you must protect from an increasing number of balls that speed up over time. This is a single-player game where your only obstacle is the physics of the bouncing balls!

How To Play:

The arc in the center that you use to defend your central square follows the mouse. Just move the mouse around the screen and the arc will spin around in a circle. Hitting with different parts of the arc will bounce the balls in different directions.

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
